### Introduction
* Programs in a logic languages are expressed in a form of symbolic logic
* Use a logical inferencing process to produce results
* Declarative rather than procedural: Only specification of results are stated (not detailed procedures for producing them)

### Symbolic Logic
* Logic which can be used for the basic needs of formal logic:
  * Express propositions
  * Express relationships between propositions
  * Describe how new propositions can be inferred from other propositions
* Particular form of symbolic logic used for logic predicate calculus

### Object Representation
* Objects in propositions are representeed by simple terms: either constants or varibles
* Constant: a symbol that represents an object
* Variable: a symbol that can represent different objects at different time

### Compound Terms
* Atomic proposition consist of compound terms
* Compound term: one element of a mathematical relation, written like a mathermatical function
  * Mathematical function is a mapping
  * Can be written as a table
  
### Parts of a Compound Term
* Compound term composed of two parts
  * Functor: function symbol that names the relationship 
  * Ordered list of parameters(tuple)
* Examples:
  student(jon)
  like(seth,osx)
  like(nick,windows)
  like(jim,linux)

### Forms of a Propostion
* Propositions can be stated in two forms:
  * Fact: proposition is assumed to be true
  * Query: truth of proposition is to be determined
* Compound proposition:
  * Have two or more atomic proposition
  * Propositions are connected by operators
